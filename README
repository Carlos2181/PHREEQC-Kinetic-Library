To facilitate the application of kinetics in geochemical modeling, kinetics rate equations and parameters for 100 minerals were programmed into a library of callable Basic language scripts for the geochemical modeling program Phreeqc (version 3.4.0). For most minerals, the rate equations take the format recommended by Palandri and Kharaka (2004). For the kinetics parameters in this format of rate equations, 66 minerals are from Palandri and Kharaka (2004), 15 are from Marty et al. (2015), and five are from other recent studies. In addition, two rate equations with parallel mechanisms, two rate equations with Langmuir adsorption isotherm format, and 12 specific rate equations were also programmed. These Basic language scripts can also be used as templates for other rate equations which users wish to use.
To use this library, users should select the phases to be included in the kinetics model, copy the scripts, and paste under the RATES block in a PHREEQC input file. For further instruction on how to build the PHREEQC input file, please refer to the manual of PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013).
