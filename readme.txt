This package is submitted along with the manuscript "A library of BASIC scripts of rate equations for geochemical modeling using PHREEQC", authored by Yilun Zhang, Bin Hu, Yanguo Teng and Chen Zhu. It contains a library of the BASIC codes for the reaction rates of 102 mineral phases. These BASIC codes are used for the RATES block in PHREEQC 3.0 (Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013).

Five files are included in this package:
PHREEQC script.txt: The BASIC codes for the RATES block in PHREEQC 3.0
Phases.txt: The thermodynamic values of the phases associated with PHREEQC script.txt
Instruction.docx: The instruction for the BASIC codes
Example1a.pqi: The example input file for PHREEQC 3.0 that uses the BASIC codes 
Example1a.pqo: The output file of Example.pqi
Example.out: The output file of Example.pqi
Example1b.pqi: The example input file for PHREEQC 3.0 that uses the BASIC codes
